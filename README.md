## Benchmarks Overview

This repository includes data and results from our benchmarking of Digital Annealer versions (DAv2 and DAv3) against various heuristics on the Max-Cut problem.

### File Formats

- **CSV files**: In general contain instance specifications, obtained cut values, baseline time limits, corresponding bitstring solutions. For the DA also contain it parameters and a breakdown of DA time components (including total duration).
- **JSON files**: Record the progress of DAv3 solutions over time.
- **TXT files**: Store terminal run outputs.

  - **DAv3:** 5 runs per instance for all 3,400 instances  
    Includes multiple 5-run batches per instance with different time limit offsets
    **Total:** ~25,781 files (CSV, TXT, JSON)
  - **38 MQLib heuristics:** 5 runs per instance on a large subset of the 3,400 instances
